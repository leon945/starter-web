What the hell?

You don’t have to stay late the next day, but you do. You want to try it again. Once everyone’s gone you press the red button. The girl calls. The pizza arrives. You eat it all. It’s freaking delicious. You press the button again and another guy shows up with pizza. You’re full, of course, so you take it home with you. You go to your computer and check your credit cards and accounts. Someone must have rigged the button to charge you. The pizzas can’t be free. Nothing’s weird in your accounts. No pizza orders. Nothing.

Days go by. Weeks fly by. One month, two months. You’ve been using the pizza button freely. You eat pizza almost every day. You’ve gained weight, but you don’t have to spend money on groceries anymore and you think it’s a fair trade-off. At first you checked your credit cards every day, then only every other day, and now it’s been six days since you last checked. Whoever is getting charged with the pizzas doesn’t mind, so you don’t mind. Gobble, gobble, yummy dear, come to bed and feed me deer. Your boss wanted to give you an office with a better view two days ago and you vehemently refused citing religious reasons. He was confused. You didn’t care. The pizza keeps coming. You keep eating.
