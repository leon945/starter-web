“Here you go, sir.” A young guy says as he hands over a pizza to your fattening self. “Thanks.” You say. He winks at you. You smile. You take a bite of the first slice of the perfect pizza and a stabbing electric pain explodes within your mouth. You’ve bitten into something hard and a tooth of yours is now chipped. “What the hell, man?” You say to no one. After examining the mushy saliva-filled remnants in your mouth, a white pebble reveals itself. It is only at this point that you worry again. Where does the pizza come from? You throw up instantly and you throw up hard right there on the street. A man is walking by and sees you with disgust. Fuck that guy.

You don’t press the button for a week, but curiosity gets the better of you. You make a plan to figure out the mystery. You press the red button. You confirm the order. And you leave the building and cross the street. You wait inside your car for the delivery guy. He shows up and leaves after waiting five minutes. You follow him. He is carrying four other pizzas which he delivers to four other buildings near yours. There must be other red buttons.

“This is it.” You say to yourself driving behind the bike. This is when your TV detective knowledge comes into play. Stay behind. Not too close. He’ll spot you. Pretend you’re talking on the phone. Follow him. The guy drives for ten minutes and stops outside a warehouse. You can hear machinery screeching intermittently inside.
