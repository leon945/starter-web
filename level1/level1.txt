You walk outside and there’s a young guy with a pizza box in his hands. He says your name. You say “Yeah”. He gives you the box and turns around and leaves on a motorcycle. The box is generic. There is no brand on it. There is no phone. There is nothing to indicate its origin. There is, however, a beautiful hot pizza inside. The most perfect pepperoni circles you have ever seen populate the half-caramelized cheese surface. You eat it all. It is delicious. You also wonder if it’s poisoned, but after remaining alive and well two hours after ingesting it, you decide it’s not.
